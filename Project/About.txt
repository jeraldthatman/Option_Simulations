Objective: Develop a library of programs to price different types of stock options. 

    Some choices involve: 
        calls and puts; 
        vanilla and exotic; 
        European, Asian, and American; 

    The Greeks; etc. if you don’t know some of these terms — well, that’s part of the project! 

    Note:   That it is possible to do a bit of this analytically,
            but simulation will have to be your main tool,
            you can also involve some variance reduction.

This is a Theory-Oriented Problem:
    - Describe the problem at hand and maybe provide a samll literature review. 
    - What techniques used to derive the main findings? 
    - Describe some of the fundamental results 
        - Example: This paper gives an explicit expression for an estimator's expected value in terms of the covariance function. 
    - Formulate (but you dont have to solve) A few research problems that may be derived from this work

Library of programs: 
1. Black scholes for European Options 
2. Binomial Optiion pricing model for pricing options. 
    - Binomial Option pricing model values options using an interative approach for American Options 
    - There are 2 kinds of possible outcomes with each iteration, a move up or down that follow a binomial tree. 
    - The model is  used more than the black scholes model. 
    - Essentially get the probability that the stock will move up or down from simulations then use that in a binomial tree over different periods
