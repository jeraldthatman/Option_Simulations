    "- In Monte carlo simulation you are really looking to reduce the standard error of your approximation.\n",
    "  - This is why the Predicted price is meaningless, however the **standard error** is **very important**\n",
    "- A main Drawback of the balck-scholes model is that it assumes a **constant volatility**\n",
    "  - Discuss the assumptions of the BS model and how they help or hurt it. \n",
    "    - Stock follows a lognormal distribution\n",
    "    - stock prices can not be negative \n",
    "    - no dividends are paid \n",
    "    - frictionless market \n",
    "    - constant volatility\n",
    "- Get data from a few different Contracts, to compare the results.  \n",
    "  - Lets try Short term, Mid term, and Long term contracts. Mind you this gives you a chance to excercise the option each day. \n",
    "    - Short term: 60 days \n",
    "    - Medium term: 180 days \n",
    "    - Long Term: 360 days\n",

    "**Main Idea:** \n",
    "1. Why are we pricing options? \n",
    "   1. We want to find the fair value of the option today\n",
    "   2. This will help us determine if an option is overpriced or not. \n",
    "2. Compare simulated, numerical, and predicted results to the observed prices.\n",
    "   1. Observed prices are set by the market maker, so we can also evaluate how much the market maker is charging for the option.\n",
    "3. Compare the standard error of the predicted prices to the standard error of the observed prices.\n",

    "**Notes From The paper:**\n",
    "- On the exercise date, the optimal exercise strategy for an American Option is to do so if the option is in the money. Prior to the exercise date, the optimal strategy is to compare the immediate exercise value with the expected cashflows from continuing to the option until the exercise date. If the immediate value is greater than the expected value at expiration, we exercise the option. Else we continue to the expiration date.\n",
    "- The holder of an American option optimally compares the payoff from the immediate exercise with the expected payoff from continutation, and then chooses to exercise if the immediate payoff is higher. \n",
    "  - The key to optimaly exercise an american option is identifying the conditional expected value of the option at the exercise date.\n",
    "    - The optimal exercise stategy is fundamentally determined by the conditional expectation of the payoff from continuing to keep the option alive. \n",
    "- A key insight from the Longstaff-Schwartz paper is that this conditional expectation can be estimated from the cross-sectional information in the simulation by using the least squares method. \n",
    "    -  More specifically Longstaff and Schwartz show that:\n",
    "       -  The ex post realized payoffs from continuation on functions of the values of the state variables on functions of the values of the state variables. \n",
    "       -  The fitted value from this regression provides a direct estimate of the conditional expectation function\n",
    "       -  By estimating the conditional expectation function for each exercise date, we obtain a complete specification of the optimal exercise strategy for the option, along each of the simulated paths. \n",
    "-  Another key insight is that the paper only only includes the paths for which the **option is in the money**. \n",
